Budget_Tracker
A long term learning project. Html, Css and JavaScript I might open to collaboration at some point.

The Plan: Aim: To build an app that allows me to track my spending.

Idea: The app(webapp) will allow me to insert a budget daily (reminder functionality) then insert my espenses as the day goes on (periodic reminders to update expenses) and at the and of the day, sum up the total spent in the day and compare with the budget for that day.

The app would then indicate if the budget was maintained and how much was saved(if I spent below budget) or how much was spent in excess and what it was spent on(if i spent above the budget).

Content: A welcome page A login page Tables to insert budget and expenses for the day (Should contain: Date, Budget for the day, expense name, expense cost, total). A result page (displayed onclick at day's end) showing how much was spent and how much over/under the budget the total was and what the extra was spent on, if in excess. A database to save the login details, tables and the daily results.

Functionalities: Start of day reminder via mail (5am adjustable) Intermittent reminders throughout the day to update expenses (10am, 2pm, 5pm adjustable) End of day reminder to calculate result (10.30 pm) Option to export tables and results to an excel spreadsheet.

Languages: HTML CSS JS PHP.

Same idea. But monthly.
